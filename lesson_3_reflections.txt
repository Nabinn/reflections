When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 When I want to share my project to github so that I can have access to the project online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	so that I can only pull when I want to.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	fork --> make copy from github to github. Used while copying projects from others. U don't want to change their project but make your own.

	clone --> clone repository into your computer. github to computer or computer to computer

	branches --> can have multiple branches in a single repository. Create new branch while working on a prject and u want to test a feature without changing the main project.
